# Cholera Data Analysis

Welcome! My name is Yensuk-george, and I am a student at VICTORIAUNIVERSITY data analyst passionate about using Python to extract meaningful insights from data.  

This project is my analysis of cholera data using a Jupyter Notebook. I invite you to explore the dataset, the code, and the insights I have generated.  

##  Files

- `cholera.ipynb` — The main Jupyter notebook containing data loading, cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
- `choleradataSetfinal.csv` — The dataset used in this analysis.

##  Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the cholera dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends, correlations, and anomalies
- Gain insights to support public health decisions

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
